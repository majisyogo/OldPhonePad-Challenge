# Old Phone Pad - C# Coding Challenge (Iron Software)

This project was created as part of the **AI Software Engineer (Junior)** coding challenge from Iron Software.

It simulates the behavior of an old mobile phone keypad:
users can input numbers, and the program converts them into letters
according to traditional T9-style mapping.

## 🧠 Features

- Converts sequences of numbers into text (e.g. `44 444# → HI`)
- Supports:
  - Multi-press letter selection
  - Space (using `0`)
  - Backspace (using `*`)
  - Input termination (`#`)
- Handles real-world typing behavior smoothly and robustly

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open the project in Visual Studio (or VS Code with C# extension)
2. Run `Program.cs`
3. The console will output the decoded text

## 🧩 AI Usage Disclosure

I used **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** to support:
- Code structuring and refactoring advice  
- English documentation writing  

However, the **core logic and debugging** were done independently.

Prompt example:
> "Help me refactor a C# program that converts old phone keypad inputs to text."
